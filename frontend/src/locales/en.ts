        "ReorderOS was born from a simple observation: most Shopify stores leave 60-80% of their potential revenue on the table because repeat purchases are treated as an afterthought.",
        "Subscription tools push lock-in. Passive reorder buttons go unnoticed. Manual reminders feel spammy. We knew there had to be a better way.",
        "We built ReorderOS to change that — a behavior-first operating system that turns random repeat purchases into a scalable, measurable revenue engine. No black-box AI. No forced subscriptions. Just intelligent, merchant-controlled design that customers actually love."
